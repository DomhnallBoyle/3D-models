# 3D-models
Directory of 3D models and STL files that I've created for personal 3D printing projects

## Current Models
- Audi A4 B6 Glovebox Hinge (RHD) - used to fix a broken hinge in an Audi A4 B6/B7 model glovebox (seems to be a common issue in these models)
- Bailer Gears - replacement gears for the roller in a round bailer
- Drain Cap - upgraded drain cap to prevent leaves getting into and blocking the gutters around the house
